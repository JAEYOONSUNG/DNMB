# Welcome to the DNMB, a comprehensive and combined scripts for genomics analysis of domesticating non-model bacteria

## Project Introduction

Welcome to our GitHub repository, where we're excited to share a series of workflows designed to streamline processes in systems biology. This repository is composed of various scripts, each tailored to specific tasks within our broader research framework. Additionally, we're providing access to a curated database to enhance your research capabilities.

## Key Features
Diverse Scripts: Our collection includes a range of scripts, each developed to address unique challenges in systems biology research.
Curated Database: Access to a comprehensive database, meticulously compiled to support and enhance your research projects.
User-Friendly Documentation: Detailed documentation is available to guide you through the installation, setup, and utilization of both the scripts and the database.
Getting Started:
To begin using our resources, please follow the steps outlined in our documentation. Whether you're looking to integrate our scripts into your existing projects or explore our database for new insights, we've provided all the necessary instructions to get you started.

### Requirements

The crisprVerse is supported for macOS, Linux and Windows machines.
